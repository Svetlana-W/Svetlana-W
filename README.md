### Hi, I am Svetlana! 

ðŸŒ± Motivated by data and problem-solving, I am curious and driven by meaningful, impactful results. I find joy in exploring diverse perspectives and crafting solutions.âš¡

My curiosity and natural enthusiasm for solving problems brought me into biomedicine, research and data technologies. With my inquisitive mindset, I never stop until I find the solution. I have a genuine interest and experience in the search and critical assessment of data, which I continuously practised for decision-making in clinical practice, secondary research field, and recently expanded into the data and technological innovations. 

I gained firm foundational data management knowledge and skills through engagement in the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) Data Engineering bootcamp where I learned data structuring, organisation, processing, retrieving, storing, and data life cycle. I learned the fundamentals of SQL syntax and advanced SQL concepts. I applied my knowledge of SQL to study databases and their design, focusing on relational databases. I practised data table normalisation to optimise transaction databases by removing redundancy and increasing data integrity.

My career is consistantly an adventure in learning and pushing boundaries. I am currently exploring my way towards blending my passion for data and blockchain technologies.
